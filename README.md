# data-structures-and-algorithms

C++ implementation of common data structures and algorithms

## Implemented:

* Doubly linked list
* Vector (Resizable array)
    * Binary search
* Hash table
* Disjoint set
* Heap (Max/min)
* LRU cache
* Graph (Directed/undirected, weighted/unweighted)
    * Dijkstra (pathfinding)
    * Kruskal (minimum spanning tree)
* Self-balancing binary search tree
    * Red/black

## TODO

* Graph
    * A* (pathfinding)
    * Bellman-Ford (pathfinding, for negatively weighted graphs)
    * Prim (minimum spanning tree)
* Radix tree
* Self balancing binary search tree
    * AVL
* B-tree
* B+tree
